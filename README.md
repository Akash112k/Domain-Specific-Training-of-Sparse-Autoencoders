# Domain Specific Training of Sparse Autoencoders


This project focusaes on:
* Leading advanced research on Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to improve model transparency, focusing on feature disentanglement and
safety for real-world applications. Developing a framework that combines feature splitting, K-sparse activation, L1 regularization, and
dynamic feature tracking for robust interpretability.

* Implementing novel circuit mapping with tools like ACDC and subgraph isolation to enhance model explainability and accuracy, aiming to
validate SAEs as scalable and interpretable solutions for complex machine learning tasks
